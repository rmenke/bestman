		      WALK-THRU for THE BEST MAN

This is a minimal walk-thru, which only exercises some of the
possible solutions to the problems.  Specifically, how to use Wolfie
(the paper spider guardian of computers) or the ice chest is not
illustrated.

There's very little you can do in the opening scene.  It's a dream
sequence designed to explain why anyone would still take a train.

> WAKE UP.

The conductor wants proof that you should be on this train.

> GIVE TICKET TO CONDUCTOR. STAND.

Time to explore, but your options at this time are pretty limited.

> NORTH.

What a mess!  No reason to appear like a slob upon arrival...

> OPEN DOOR. WEST.
> TURN ON WATER.
> CLOSE DOOR. LOCK IT.
> CLEAN JACKET.

Hmmm... we need to convince the terrorists that the lavatory is
unoccupied.

> UNLOCK DOOR. TURN OFF WATER.

Still, a search is possible.  Best to find someplace to hide.

> OPEN WINDOW. WEST.
> WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. EAST.

Time to go exploring.  The ticket and schedule are unimportant: lose
them.

> GET TICKET, SCHEDULE. DROP ALL.
> OPEN DOOR. EAST.
> NORTH. NORTH. NORTH. NORTH.

The door with the painted window looks interesting...

> OPEN DOOR. WEST.
> SEARCH SHELF. LOOK UNDER TABLE.
> GET ACID, FLUID, RED BULB, TUBE.

The terrorists are in the next car, so we need to find a way around
them.

> EAST. NORTH.
> PUT ALL IN JACKET.
> STAND ON RAIL.
> UP. NORTH.

Time to eliminate the terrorists in the car below.  There are many
ways of doing this: this one is the most direct.

> GET FLUID. OPEN IT.
> OPEN ACID. POUR ACID IN FLUID.
> PUT FLUID ON VENT.
> CLOSE ACID.

More exploring...

> DOWN. NORTH.
> OPEN CHEST. GET ALL FROM IT.
> PUT ALL IN JACKET. SOUTH. UP.
> CLOSE FLUID.
> DOWN. SOUTH.

You can poke around in here, but there's not much to do yet.  Keep
exploring...

> SOUTH. SOUTH. SOUTH. SOUTH. SOUTH.
> UP. SOUTH. DOWN.
> OPEN CRATE.

Oh dear...  First we need to handle the trap of the gas-filled tube.

> GET WHITE BULB. DROP IT.
> GET RED BULB. SCREW IT INTO SOCKET.
> PULL CORD. CLOSE HATCH.

Now we need to neutralize the white powder.

> GET CAN. PUT IT IN GOOP.
> SQUIRT LUBRICANT ON WHITE POWDER.

Now you can cut the glass!

> OPEN SMALL BOX.
> CUT PANE WITH RING.

Don't forget-- the lubricant WILL evaporate.

> GET DISH. DROP IT.

The beaker problem is tough.  The hint is that they're attached to
scales... even though they're balanced in weight, they're still not
balanced.  Use the litmus to find out why.

> OPEN SMALL TUBE.
> POUR LITMUS INTO LEFT.
> POUR LITMUS INTO RIGHT.

OK, the left beaker is filled with base, the right with acid.  The
acid from the darkroom and the cleaner will neutralize the beakers,
respectively.  Add small amounts until the solutions turn purple.

> OPEN ACID. OPEN CLEANER.
> POUR 5ML FROM ACID INTO LEFT BEAKER.
> AGAIN.
> AGAIN.
  ...
> POUR 5ML FROM CLEANER INTO RIGHT BEAKER.
> AGAIN.
> AGAIN.
  ...

Now they're pH balanced, but not balanced by volume.  You can either
get some water from the lavatory, or simply take advantage of the fact 
that the right beaker is filled with a neutral solution.

> POUR 75ML FROM RIGHT BEAKER INTO LEFT BEAKER.

The box should open with a *CLICK*.

> GET ACID, CLEANER. DROP ALL.
> OPEN BOX.
> GET SPHERE.
> GET PHOTO.
> GET OIL.
> PUT ALL IN JACKET.

> OPEN HATCH. UP. NORTH. DOWN. NORTH. NORTH.
> NORTH. NORTH. NORTH. NORTH. NORTH.

> GET BLACK SPHERE. DROP IT.

(You could also use the ice chest to get rid of the sphere.)

> SOUTH. EXAMINE FLOOR. OPEN HATCH. DOWN.
> NORTH. SEARCH UNDERCARRIAGE.
> GET WHITE BOX. PUT IT IN JACKET.
> SOUTH. SOUTH.
> GET WHITE BOX. DROP IT.
> NORTH. SQUIRT OIL ON LEVER.
> PULL LEVER. YES.

Get out of there, quickly!

> UP. UP. WAIT. SOUTH. SOUTH. SOUTH. SOUTH.
> EXAMINE CONTROLS. EXAMINE PLAQUE.
> EXAMINE THROTTLE. EXAMINE BRAKE.
> EXAMINE CONDUCTOR. EXAMINE PHOTO.
> SHOW PHOTO TO HIM.

Now, time is tight.  If you examined the schedule, Capistrano is the
last stop before Escondido...

> ASK CONDUCTOR ABOUT LILY.
  (Also, THROW WOLFIE AT CONDUCTOR.  Both may be used for extra time.)
> PULL THROTTLE. PULL BRAKE.

Not much you can do here.  Relax, help is on its way...

> WAKE. RUN. EXAMINE BAR. UP. DOWN. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.

Ah, finally made it!  Just one last thing to do...

> GIVE RING TO JACK.
