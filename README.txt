This archive contains four files:  this file (README.txt), an inform
story file (bestman.z5), a copy of "All Aboard" magazine (bmanpkg.pdf),
and a map of the game (bmanmap.pdf).

Only the magazine is required reading; it contains some information
that may not be common knowledge but is required to solve at least one
puzzle.  It also contains a newspaper clipping that provides some
background to the game.

At least one puzzle is given away by the map; it should only be used
if the player feels that they may have missed a location somewhere
along the way.
